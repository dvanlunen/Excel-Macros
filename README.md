# Excel Macros

Excel is the most commonly used tool for viewing data. Though most heavy lifting of data analysis happens elsewhere, often results are exported to xlsx so they are universal.

This repo is meant to list Excel macros that quickly format or manipulate spreadsheets so that they can be quickly shared.
